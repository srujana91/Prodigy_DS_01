# Prodigy_DS_01
## World Population Visualization (2023)

This Python code, intended for use in Google Colab, creates a horizontal bar chart depicting the top 20 most populous countries in the year 2023. The data is sourced from the World Bank's dataset `API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2_23.csv` (or a file path you provide).

Requirements:

- Python 3.0
- Libraries:
    - pandas
    - matplotlib

Instructions:

1. Upload the Dataset:
   - Execute the code block to upload the CSV file containing population data. Ensure the file format matches the expected structure (country names and a column for 2023 population).

2. Run the Script:
   - Execute the remaining code cells to process the data, generate the chart, and display the results.

Output:

The code will produce a horizontal bar chart showcasing the top 20 countries with their corresponding population figures for 2023. Countries with the highest populations will be positioned at the top of the chart.

Data Source:

- This code has access to the World Bank's dataset `API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2_23.csv`. 

Customization:

- While the code is functional, you can customize the visualization using Matplotlib's extensive functionalities. For instance, you can modify chart colors, fonts, labels, and other visual elements to suit your preferences.

**Further Enhancements:**

- Error handling can be implemented to gracefully manage potential issues like file upload errors or missing data.
- Explore using a publicly available online data source (e.g., World Bank API) to automate data retrieval and avoid manual uploads.

By incorporating this code and explanations into your GitHub repository, you'll provide valuable context and instructions for users who wish to understand and potentially modify the script.
